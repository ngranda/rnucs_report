\section{INTRODUCTION}

The \textit{rnucs} tally has been implemented in MCNP6.2. In order
to assess the correct implementation of the tally, a quantitative
comparison to the tally implemented in MCNP6.1 has been performed.

\section{COMPARISON OF RNUCS IN MCNP6.1 AND MCNP6.2}

\subsection{Geometry}
A simple geometry was selected for this comparison. 
The geometry consists of a single mercury volume as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:merbox.png}.
A Gaussian distribution centered around 1GeV proton source was used. 
The source is located in the xy plane at z = -256.71 cm, where the x position is
dependent on the y position.

\end{figure}


\subsection{MCNP Transport}
A transport calculation was performed with MCNP6.1 and MCNP6.2 and 1E8 histories.
The \textit{rnucs} tally was used in both calculations to obtain
the isotope production and destruction in the mercury volume. 

\subsection{Analysis of Transport Results}
Figures \ref{fig:prod} and \ref{fig:dest}  show the isotope production
and isotope destruction collected in the mercury volume respectively. These figures also
show the relative difference between the results collected in MCNP6.1
and MCNP6.2. 
The relative difference is given by the following equation:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{MCNP6.2 - MCNP6.1}{MCNP6.1}.
\end{equation}

        \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{figs/prod_merbox_62_61.pdf}

        \label{fig:prod}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht]

	\caption{Isotope Destruction in the Mercury volume}
        \label{fig:dest}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:prod} shows that for many isotopes the isotope 
production obtained in MCNP6.2 is significantly different than the
isotope production obtained in MNCP6.1. 
To better understand the importance of
the difference, a graph representing the relative difference versus the
isotope production data in MCNP6.1 is shown in Figure \ref{fig:reldiff}. This 
figure tells us that most of the isotopes with high relative difference
have a low isotope production.

Another metric used in this work to compare the results is the Z-test.
A Z-test is a statistical test used to determine the differences between 
two means. This test yields a z-score which quantifies the 
number of standard deviations a sample mean is from a
population
mean. In this comparison, two sample means are compared and the following
equation is used. 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ztest}
        z = \frac{(\bar{x}_{1} - \bar{x_{2}}) - (\mu_{1} - \mu_{2}) }
            {\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{1}^{2}}{n_{1}} + \frac{\sigma_{2}^{2}}{n_{2}} }}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
        \bar{x} &= \text{Sample mean} \\
        \mu     &= \text{Population mean} \\
        \sigma  &= \text{Population standard deviation} \\
        n       &= \text{Sample size}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

A z-test is performed for each isotope  and an individual z-score obtained. 
Using the hypothesis that the population means are equal, we set 
 $ \mu_{1} - \mu_{2} = 0$.

A PDF of the z-scores comparing the isotope production tallied in 
MNCP6.1 and MCNP6.2 can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:pdf}. 
The percent of voxels with a certain z-score can be seen in Table \ref{tab:zscore}.
