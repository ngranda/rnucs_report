\section{INTRODUCTION}

This document serves as formal documentation of the implementation of
the \textit{rnucs} tally in MCNP6.2. A comparison to the implemention
in MCNP6.1 will be shown in this document. 

\section{COMPARISON OF RNUCS IN MCNP6.1 AND MCNP6.2}

\subsection{Geometry}
A simple geometry was selected and can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:merbox.png}.
A Gaussian distribution centered around 1GeV proton source was used. 
The source is located in the xy plane at z = -256.71 cm, where the x position is
dependent in the y position.
