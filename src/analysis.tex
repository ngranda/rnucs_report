\section{Analysis}\label{sc:analysis}
In order to asses the correct progress of the rnucs-mesh workflow, a few 
analysis were performed on verification problems designed to have interaction in the 
high energy region. 

\subsection{Problem Description}
Two verification problems were identified to asses the correctness of the 
rnucs-mesh workflow. 
Verification problem I (shown in Figure \ref{TPI}) consists of a mercury rectangular prism that is 
22 cm x 44 cm x 186 cm.

\end{figure}
Verification problem II (shown in Figure \ref{TPII}) has a rectangular prism enclosing another rectangular
prism. 
The mercury cell has the same dimensions as those of verification problem I. The steel 
cell, which encloses the mercury, is double the size of the mercury cell.

Both verification problems have a source that models that of the
actual SNS systems. The source is a proton source with energy gaussian dritribution
around 1 GeV. The source is located in a distributed xy plane at z = -256.71 cm, 
where the distribution of the x plane denpends on the y location. 

\subsubsection{Spatial Discretization}
Several superimposed meshes were laid upon Verification Problem I and II. 
The superimposed meshes were 1x1x1, 2x2x2, and 4x4x4. Both verification problems
were also split into 8 equal pieces and 64 equal pieces creating a total of
six distint geometries including the originals. 
Splitting verification problem II into 8 equal cells required some material mixing. 
Each cell in this particular geometry was assigned a steel-mercury mixture
of 3:1. 
This splitting was done in order to compare to the mesh problems. 

\subsection{Workflow to Photon Emissions}
In order to generate the spectrum file, the following steps were carried out:
\begin{itemize}
\item Monte Carlo transport using MCNP 
\item Activation script was run to create the input files for CINDER and  run CINDER
\end{itemize}
A total of 12 problems were run, six for each verification problem. The runs were as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Cell rnucs. Mercury cell for Verification Problem I and Mercury and Steel cell for
Verification Problem II.
\item 1x1x1 uniformly distributed mesh superimposed on the whole problem
\item 2x2x2 uniformly distributed mesh superimposed on the whole problem
\item 4x4x4 uniformly distributed mesh superimposed on the whole problem
\item Geometry split into 8 equal pieces
\item Geometry split into 64 equal pieces
\end{itemize}
Each case was run with 1E6 history particles.
