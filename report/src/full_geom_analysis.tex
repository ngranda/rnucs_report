\section{Full Production Problem}
Analysis of a full \gls{sns} geometry was perfomed using the cell
based \gls{sdr} workflow and the mesh based \gls{sdr} workflow.
The geometry is shown in Figure \ref{fig:idk}\\
The area of interest during the analysis is the target area of the model.
For the cell based workflow, the flux and nuclide information was collected
in geometric cell belonging to the target as seen in figure \ref{fig:idk}.
For the mesh based workflow, a Cartesian mesh was superimposing covering the
target. It is important to note that due to the mesh being non-conformal, there
are sections of other geometric volumes in the cell. This does not affect the
neutron flux and nuclide information collected during the first transport as
the mesh based workflow is designed to reject cells of no interest.
Figure \ref{fig:idk} shows the nuclide production information collected during
the neutron transport. The nuclide production is added across all cells and the
across all voxels in a mesh for easy comparison. The bottom graph shows the
relative difference between the results collected in the mesh and the results
collected in the cells. There are only small differences  between the two
results. This is due to the mesh being able to reject the cells.
